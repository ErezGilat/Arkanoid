# Arkanoid 
This is the final project of my OOP class after I made some updates and upgrades that I thought might add to the fun.
The program was written in Java and it deploys some of the main ideas behind a video game such as, Sprite, GUI, and geometry 📐.
I added the GUI which I used for my program and I suggest you to use it.
Hope you will have some fun :)

compile:
```
ant compile
```
run:
```
ant run
```
In order to play specific levels:
```
ant -Dargs="1 1" run
